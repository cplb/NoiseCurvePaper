\section{Sensitivity curves}\label{app:a}
The plots in this section show all of the detectors and sources described in the text. Interactive versions of these plots may be viewed on-line, \url{http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~rhc26/sources/}. The detector noise curves all have their resonance spikes removed for clarity.
