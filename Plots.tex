\section{Sensitivity curves}\label{app:a}
The plots in this section show all of the detectors and sources described in the main text. Clearer, interactive versions of these plots, allowing for removal of any of the curves, may be created and downloaded on-line, \url{http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~rhc26/sources/}. The detector noise curves all have their resonance spikes removed for clarity.
