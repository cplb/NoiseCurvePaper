\title{Gravitational wave sensitivity curves}

\begin{abstract}
There are several common conventions in use by the gravitational wave community to describe the amplitude of sources and the sensitivity of detectors. These are frequently confused. We outline the merits and differences between the various quantities used for parametrising noise curves and characterising gravitational wave amplitudes. Sensitivity curves plots for each of the conventions are presented and interactive versions have been made available on-line at \url{http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~rhc26/sources/}.

\section{Concluding remarks}\label{sec:discussion}
When quantifying the sensitivity of a GW detector and the loudness of a GW source there are three commonly used quantities: the characteristic strain, the power spectral density, and the spectral energy density. Here we have carefully defined these quantities and derived the relationships between them. In addition example sensitivity curve plots using each of these quantities have been presented for a wide range of ground based detectors, space based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. Also plotted are predicted amplitudes for a wide range of sources, these predictions are based on astrophysical estimates of the event rates for a range of processes and are subject to varying degrees of uncertainty. There also exists the exciting possibility of sources nobody has yet considered. Interactive versions of these plots with user specified detectors and sources are made available on-line at \url{http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~rhc26/sources/}. Trying to summarise an entire field of astronomy on one plot is an impossible task; however we hope that the figures and analysis presented here provide useful insight.
