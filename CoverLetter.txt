Dear Sir

This paper has grown slowly out of the collective studies of the authors. It started as a set of notes for our own benefit before being used as introductory material for new PhD students and finally maturing to its current form. It has now been circulated to a large number of experienced researchers, most recently during an internal review process by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), and has been well received.

We believe that CQG is the best place to communicate our work. With regards to your criteria for publication, papers should:

- Be original, novel and add significantly to research already published. We derive ab initio the relationships between the different characterisations of gravitational-wave amplitude. The gravitational-wave community is now large and well developed, and as such many characterisations exist. This is a frequent source of confusion for even experienced researchers and can be, frankly, bewildering for newcomers to the field! There is a clear need for a resource that presents a self-contained derivation of the relationships between these quantities and a discussion of their relative merits. We are unaware of any document that provides a rigorously derived conversion between all the different conventions. We also believe that our explanation of why different conventions are used is novel. The paper also accompanies another new resource for use by the community, which is the online, interactive curve plotter described in the paper.

- Be of interest to the community. We were extremely pleased by the responses we received from the recent internal LSC review. Many individuals from the community contacted us to discuss the merits of the different conventions, and how they related to their own work. Everyone we have discussed this paper with in person has said that they think the paper would be a welcome addition to the literature and they would find it useful to refer to. This shows that there is a clear demand for a paper of this type.

- Have sound motivation and purpose. With the era of gravitational-wave astronomy fast approaching (the next few years will see the commissioning of multiple ground-based detectors, the unification of the current-generation of pulsar timing arrays to form the IPTA, and work beginning on the mission to address the ESA L3 theme: the gravitational universe), there will be increased interest in gravitational waves. Those outside the community will wish to understand the work being done and so what the various conventions really mean. Those in the field need to be able to provide clear explanations to non-experts. Both could use a reference that provides a solid, unified understanding of the meaning of the sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors and the expected amplitudes of their sources.

We are aware that the flavour of this paper is somewhat different from the majority published in this journal; in some ways this is slightly more akin to a review article. However, the authors feel that the pedagogical nature of the paper, and the exceedingly good fit for the target audience of your journal mean this paper is an excellent candidate for CQG.

We hope you will agree, and we look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,

Christopher Moore, Robert Cole and Christopher Berry
